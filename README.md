### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Government Digital Experience - Public-facing websites to inform and assist the people of BC

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all things GitHub: PRs, Markdown, and Actions (next I'll learn containers, Kubernetes, and OpenShift)

âš¡ Fun fact: A daily meditation practice (first thing in the morning!) can help you
   - regulate your emotions (stay chill on that commute)
   - build your will power (executive malfunctions begone!)
   - cultivate a quiet(er) mind (what was I thinking about just now?)
